# ML Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect Four

Developed as part of the coursework for CAP5404 - Deep Learning For Computer Graphics

## Description

In this project, we will be exploring the application of machine learning to develop an AI-based player for a two-player game environment. Specifically, we will be developing and evaluating the performance of an ML model for a game of Connect Four. We begin by testing the performance of various classification and regression models in the context of Tic-Tac-Toe. While a computer player for a game of Tic-Tac-Toe can be developed based on the minimax algorithm, testing machine learning models for this task could be an interesting exercise and also provide a baseline for the performance and contextualize the results of all the tested models, which can help us select a model to test on the Connect Four game. This will help us understand how and whether simple machine learning models can be used to develop an AI-based player for zero-sum games.
